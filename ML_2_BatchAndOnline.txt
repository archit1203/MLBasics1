Batch/Offline ML
    Conventional way to train a ML model
    All data is used together to train our model
    No incremental training(not in small groups)
    Deployed on server once the model is completely trained.
    Training only done offline

    Problems:
        Constant retraining
    
    Cons:
        Lots of data
        H/W limitation
        Availbility

Online ML
    Incremental training is done 
        data is feeded in small batches sequentially
        model improves after every training
        model is trained online 
    Both learning and prediction is done on the server
    eg Chatbots

    When to use what Online learning
        ->Concept drift
            When the concept or logic of our mdel is very volatile then Online could be used
            e.g. stock exchnage, ecom sites
        ->Cost effective
            Use online
        ->Faster Solution
    
    Cons
        ->Tricky
        ->Risky
            biasness due to inputs
            need to make monitoring system

Complexity      Less complex as model is constant       dynamic complexity as it keeps on evolving
Comp. Power     Fewer                                   continous data input, so comp.is high
Implement       Easy                                    Difficult
eg              Image recogition, pattern is const.     Finance, Econ, health where pattern keeps changing

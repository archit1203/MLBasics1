What is ML?
    ML is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give
    computer ssystems the ability to "learn" with data without being
    explicitly programmed.

    Explicit Program -> To write a code for all possible scenarios.

    ML-> We've got some data on which we apply some algos on it to find patterns 
            from training data in order to generate outputs for test data input.
            Simply we train the machine to work by itself to perfrom a particular task.

            Traditional Programming:
                         ___________
            Data    ->  |   Data    | -> Output
            Program ->  |___________|

            Machine Learning:
                         ___________
            Data    ->  |   Data    | -> Program
            Output  ->  |___________|

In what scenarios ML can be used?
    1. You cannot write cases for everything.
    2. Too many cases (e.g. image recognition)
    3. Data Mining

Why ML only now?
    ML has been around since a really long time. But it could never become 
    prominent because ML recquires datta to work on but at that time it was
    really hard to 
        -> Gather & Label data was a tedious job
        -> H/W was not strong enough to run that much amount of data on algos
    But in the recent times both of these issues has been effectively resolved.

AI vs ML vs DL
    DL subset ML subset AI
    Intelligence: It constitutes of many things like:
        Pattern recognition
        Creativity & Imagination
        Emotional Intelligence
    Most AI stuff currently is towards Pattern recognition

    AI: since 1950s ->  expert systems (80s) only works on closed system and 
            not fuzzy logic cannot work only on if-else
        It leverages computers and machines to mimic the problem-solving and 
            decision-making capabilities of the human mind.

    ML: Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and 
        computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to 
        imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

        Better for small data.

    DL: It is a type of machine learning based on artificial neural networks 
        in which multiple layers of processing are used to extract progressively 
        higher level features from data.

        It is a class of ML Algos inspired by biological neurons.
        A big problem with ML is that you need to provide with the features. But
         DL is capable of creating them on its own. It extracts the features.
        As we add layers of neurons our efficiency increases.

        ML at one point saturates as we provide the data in terms of efficiency, but 
         the graph of DL keeps on increasing.
        
        Better for large data

What are types of Data?
    1. Numerical data   
        eg Age, Weight , marks
    2. Categorical data
        eg Gender, Nationality

What are types of ML?
         (Amount of supervision needed)
    1. Supervised
        We have both input & output
        We need to do prediction for new data based on the patterns learnt from
            training data.
        a. Regression
            Output is numerical
            eg house price prediction
        b. Classification
            Output is Categorical
            eg weather prediction

    2. Unsupervised
        We have only input
        a. Clustering
            Can divide even n-dimensional hyper space into clusters
        b. Dimensionality Reduction
            Removing extra unwanted colums/dimensions/inputs
        c. Anomoly Detection
            Detecting outliers and removing it
        d. Association
            

    3. Semi-Supervised
        Partially Supervised & Unsupervised

    4. Reinforcement

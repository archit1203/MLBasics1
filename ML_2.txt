Batch/Offline ML
    Conventional way to train a ML model
    All data is used together to train our model
    No incremental training(not in small groups)
    Deployed on server once the model is completely trained.

    Problems:
        Constant retraining
    
    Cons:
        Lots of data
        H/W limitation
        Availbility

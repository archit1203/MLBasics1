Numpy
    Written in C & FORTRAN
    Used for level mathematical functions
    Uses the concept of multidimensional arrays and functions
    fundamental package for scientific computing in Python
    Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, 
     various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), 
     and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, 
     including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, 
     selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, 
     basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.
    At the core of the NumPy package, is the ndarray object. This 
     encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types
    
    Numpy Arrays Vs Python Sequences
        NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike Python lists 
         (which can grow dynamically). Changing the size of an ndarray will 
         create a new array and delete the original.

        The elements in a NumPy array are all required to be of the same datatype, 
         and thus will be the same size in memory.

        NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations 
         on large numbers of data. Typically, such operations are executed more 
         efficiently and with less code than is possible using Pythonâ€™s built-in 
         sequences.

        A growing plethora of scientific and mathematical Python-based packages are 
         using NumPy arrays; though these typically support Python-sequence input, 
         they convert such input to NumPy arrays prior to processing, and they often 
         output NumPy arrays.

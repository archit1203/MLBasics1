Machine Learning Development Life Cycle
    1. Frame the problem
        Decide what exactly is the problem, cost, cutomers, end product, type of
        model , algos, data
    
    2. Gathering the data
        Gathering the relevant data
            CSV, API, Web Scrapping, Data warehousing
    
    3. Data Preprocessing
        Unclean data when comes from outside
        Remove dulicates, missing values, outliers
        Scale Standardisation

    4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)    
        We analyse our data here
        We try to study the relationship b/w input and output
        We need to know what is there in our data
        We do 
            -> visualisation
            -> We do independant analysis on all the columns (univariate analysis/bivariate)
                Outlier detection
                Imbalenced dataset
    5. Feature Engineering and selection
        Sometimes we create some new columns to make our analysis easy
        Selecting relevant features

    6. Model Training, Evaluation & Selection
        Once we're sure about our data, now we are ready to train our model
        We apply multple algos and evaluate their results to finalisse which
            model to use based on performance matrix
    
    7. Model Deployment
        The models can be deployed on the cloud and local server, web browser, 
        package as software, and edge device. After that, you can use API, web app, 
        plugins, or dashboard to access the predictions. 

    8. Testing
        Beta Testing
        Feedback on model
    
    9. Optimize
        Optimizing our model to best version

Instance Based learning
    Instance-based learning refers to a family of techniques for 
    classification and regression, which produce a class label/predication 
    based on the similarity of the query to its nearest neighbor(s) in the 
    training set.
    
    It is called instance-based because it builds the hypotheses from the 
    training instances. It is also known as memory-based learning or 
    lazy-learning (because they delay processing until a new instance must 
    be classified).

Model Based learning
    Model-based learning is the formation and subsequent development of mental 
    models by a learner. Most often used in the context of dynamic phenomena, 
    mental models organize information about how  components of systems 
    interact to produce the dynamic phenomena.

Challenges in ML 
    Data Collection
        Gathering data is a difficult task
    Insufficient Data
    Labelled Data
    Poor representation (sampleing noise & Sampeling bias)
    Poor Quality of data 
        Many outliers
        Missing values
    Irrelevant Features
    Overfitting
        Overfitting is a concept in data science, which occurs when a statistical 
        model fits exactly against its training data. When this happens, the 
        algorithm unfortunately cannot perform accurately against unseen data, 
        defeating its purpose.
    Underfitting
        Underfitting is a scenario in data science where a data model is unable to 
        capture the relationship between the input and output variables accurately, 
        generating a high error rate on both the training set and unseen data.
    Software Integration
        Too many platforms and not all are ready
    Deployment
    Cost Involved
